# Destiny 2 Clan Viewer Website

Ever wanted a website all about your Destiny 2 clan? Well, I've tried different ways of helping people in the community build just that, but it turns out coding is hard! Without a computer science education, replicating something like [ascendant.gg](https://ascendant.gg) is pretty much impossible.

So, I decided to just make a public website to show all D2 clans with bookmarkable URLs and open source the whole thing. All my Destiny 2 related code can be found in this repository, and you're free to use it however you'd like, if you want to try to create your own version of [ascendant.gg](https://ascendant.gg), or your own Destiny 2 clan website.

Yes, you can contact me with questions, but I can't guarantee my response time.
